# SPID Protocol Roadmap

The SPID Protocol is more than just a spec — it’s the foundation for a new layer of communication: **voice-first, AI-native, human-approved content**.

This roadmap outlines what we’ve built, what’s in progress, and what’s coming next across the protocol, tooling, ecosystem, and governance.

---

## Phase 1: Core Protocol & Spec (COMPLETE)

- [x] Smart Packet format finalized (`/docs/packet-format.md`)
- [x] PulseID identity layer defined
- [x] Basic SPID resolution flow defined
- [x] Public GitHub documentation and examples
- [x] Hosted demo Smart Packets + public showcases

---

## Phase 2: Developer Tools (IN PROGRESS)

- [ ] Open-source Smart Packet Viewer (web component)
- [ ] SPID CLI tool for validating and generating packets
- [ ] Smart Packet Generator (web-based UI)
- [ ] PulseID Registration Directory (public preview)
- [ ] API for querying packets by intent, tags, or SPID

---

## Phase 3: Assistant + Platform Integration

- [ ] Voice assistant starter templates (Node.js, Python, React)
- [ ] Realtime API integration (e.g., OpenAI Assistants, Whisper, TTS)
- [ ] Cross-agent routing via Smart Packet handoffs
- [ ] Plugins for CRM, helpdesks, podcast apps, and SMS tools

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem + Standardization

- [ ] Schema registry and community-voted intent taxonomy
- [ ] DNS + JSON-LD + semantic web indexing
- [ ] Partnerships with AI model providers (search, chat, agents)
- [ ] Smart Packet SEO guidelines (GEO: Generative Engine Optimization)

---

## Phase 5: Governance & Trust Framework

- [ ] Open contributor council and working group
- [ ] Verified PulseIDs and trust badges
- [ ] Optional packet signing and expiration standards
- [ ] Public proposal system (like W3C or RFC model)

---

## Vision: The SPID-Powered Future

Imagine a world where:

- Every person and business has a **voice-first identity**.
- Every AI assistant can **pull verified packets**, not just hallucinate answers.
- Every voice message is **structured, archived, and actionable**.
- Every platform is **interoperable**, using open formats instead of silos.

That’s what we’re building — and you’re early.
