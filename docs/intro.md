# SPID Protocol

Smart Packets. Structured Answers. Voice-Ready.

## 🔍 What is SPID?

SPID is a resolution and retrieval protocol for AI agents, apps, and users to access structured, voice-ready content units called Smart Packets — complete with transcripts, metadata, intents, and CTAs.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

SPID replaces guesswork and scraping with resolution. For example:
```spid://acme/widget123``` → instantly retrieves the structured packet.

## 📦 Key Components

- **Smart Packet Format** — Self-contained, structured answers
- **SPID URIs** — Globally unique addresses
- **SPID Directory** — Central resolution service
- **PulseIDs** — Async inboxes for agents and people
