# Welcome to the SPID Protocol Docs

The **Smart Packet Identifier (SPID) Protocol** is a modern resolution and retrieval system for AI-powered, intent-aware, and voice-ready communication.

---

## 🔍 What is SPID?

SPID defines how apps, AI assistants, and users access **Smart Packets** — structured, portable content units that include metadata, transcripts, intents, and actions.

It’s optimized for:
- ✅ Voice-first environments  
- ✅ Intent-based interactions  
- ✅ Retrieval-based AI (not crawling)

Think of it like DNS + Open Graph + email — for the AI era.

## 🚀 Why It Matters

Traditional systems rely on scraping and guessing. SPID uses resolution:

```
spid://acme/widget123
```

Instantly resolves a structured, human-approved Smart Packet.

## 📦 Key Components

- **Smart Packet Format** — Self-contained structured answers
- **SPID URIs** — Globally unique identifiers
- **SPID Directory** — Central resolution + metadata lookup
- **PulseIDs** — Async inboxes for agents and people
