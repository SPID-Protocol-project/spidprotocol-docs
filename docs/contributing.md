# Contributing to the SPID Protocol

The SPID Protocol is an open standard designed for a new, voice-native, AI-aware internet — and we can’t build it alone.

Whether you're a developer, designer, business owner, content creator, or just curious — there’s a place for you in this movement.

## Ways You Can Contribute

### 1. Improve the Protocol or Documentation
- Suggest edits, additions, or clarifications to the spec
- Help document real-world use cases
- Submit issues, feedback, or pull requests on GitHub

> Start with [Spec](spec) or [Packet Format](packet-format)

---

### 2. Build With SPID

- Create tools, templates, or viewers for Smart Packets
- Build open-source resolvers or inbox tools
- Prototype Smart Packet integrations for your app or assistant

Tag your project with `spid-protocol` and link to [spidprotocol.org](https://spidprotocol.org)

### 3. Share Your Use Case

Have a Smart Packet use case in healthcare, coaching, education, or async sales? We'd love to highlight it.

- Open a PR to [Use Cases](use-cases)
- Add a post to the `/blog`
- Submit a demo link or walkthrough to our team
