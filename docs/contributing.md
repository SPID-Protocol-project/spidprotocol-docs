# 🤝 Contributing to the SPID Protocol

The SPID Protocol is an open standard designed for a new, voice-native, AI-aware internet — and we can’t build it alone.

Whether you're a developer, designer, business owner, content creator, or just curious — there’s a place for you in this movement.

### 🧪 2. Build With SPID
