# 🛰️ SPID Protocol

The **SPID Protocol** is an open standard for structured, voice-first communication — enabling AI assistants, agents, and humans to retrieve trusted, actionable content called **Smart Packets**.

---

## 📦 What Is a Smart Packet?

Smart Packets are AI-native, voice-ready answers that include:

- 🔊 A short voice message (human or AI)
- 📜 A full transcript
- 🧠 Intent tags for routing and retrieval
- 🎯 Up to 3 call-to-action (CTA) buttons
- 🏷️ Metadata for search, security, and lifespan

They're like mini-landing pages for the AI web — structured, portable, and human-approved.

## 🔄 What Is SPID?

SPID stands for **Smart Packet Identity** — a unique, verifiable identity for people, brands, and bots to publish and receive Smart Packets.

Example PulseIDs:

spid:brand:nike-support
 spid:creator:elena-podcast
 spid:voiceagent:ai-morty
